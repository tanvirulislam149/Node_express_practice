Making Node express backend project
1. npm init
2. make .gitignore and add node_modules, .env in it 
3. install express and nodemon (for quick reload)
4. write in scripts of package.json => start: node server.js, dev: nodemon server.js and start the server by npm run dev. It will start by nodemon and will reload instantly.
5. install dotenv to use env file and define PORT in env file and use it in server.js with || 5000
6. send response like this ===>>> res.status(200).json({message: "something"})
7. make folder for every perticular route and write app.use() in server.js. Check docs
8. use router.route for different methods of same route in routes file. 
9. make controller(Just an arrow function) folder and file to keep the business logic
10. To get data from frontend, write ==>>  app.use(express.json()) in server.js file 
11. req.body >> gets all the data from frontend
12. create a middleware folder and write middleware functions in it and use them in server.js by app.use(middlewareName). It will be called in every request in next() is called.
